## Frequent concerns

#### Can a drone fly over my property? 

- Property rights in most US states do *not* extend to the unregulated class G airspace above a property (500 ft). Current legal precident does not restrict flights over private property as long as the flight does not cause excessive distress due to noise (Boggs v. Merideth; United States v. Causby)


#### Can a drone peer in my window?

- Legally it depends on the state and the 'reasonable expectation of privacy'. In reality, most drones don't have optics with zoom capabilities. Responsible pilots are far more interested in viewing the outside world than the inside of your house. 

#### Can drones video record me while I'm outside?
 
- In most states, to film/photograph a person in a public place from a distance is completly legal. You can assume an expectation to privacy in a public venue. Responsible piolts do not fly within 25 meters of any person. Most drones do not have optics with zoom capability.

#### Can drones zoom in on me?

- Most drones have fixed focus length lenses comparible to a 35mm or smart phone camera. Hobbyist drones can't cary the weight of a telephoto lens, and typically see compariable to what a human eyeball would see from the same distance.
